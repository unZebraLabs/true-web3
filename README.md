# From "Folder-Style Web3" to a "Hardware-Native Network"

> "As long as the NIC is beating, our civilization will not disappear due to Big Tech shutting down their servers."

## 1. The Status Quo: Web3 is Just a "Temporary Folder"
Current Web3 is a pseudo-proposition. We claim decentralization, yet our DNS is rented, our code is hosted (GitHub), and our nodes are leased (AWS/Google Cloud). 

**The Pain Point:** If the foundation of Web2 is pulled away, the so-called Web3 is nothing more than an ".exe" program running on someone else's server—it would be erased instantly.

## 2. Core Architecture: Hardware as Nodes, IP as Coordinates
We are building a native protocol that relies entirely on **physical hardware (NIC)** and IPv6, completely independent of centralized cloud services.

* **The Hardware ID:** Leveraging the near-infinite allocation capacity of IPv6, every physical Network Interface Card (NIC) globally gets a unique, physically-bound global IP coordinate.
* **True P2P (Serverless):** Data transmission no longer routes through `google.com` or `infura.io`. It relies on direct IP-to-IP physical handshakes. We are building roads directly in the "dirt," instead of borrowing the highways of Big Tech.

## 3. Data Storage: Distributed "Soul-Sharding"
Your accounts, balances, and data are no longer stored in any centralized database.

* **Fragmented Storage:** Data is encrypted, shredded, and scattered across the hard drives of all users running this protocol globally.
* **Mathematical Redundancy:** As long as a single machine on Earth (even a tiny NIC chip on a motherboard) remains powered, your data fragments are immortal.
* **Private Key Reconstruction:** The private key is no longer just a proof of assets; it is the sole algorithmic key to fish out and reassemble your personal data from the "islands" of the entire network.

## 4. The Ecosystem: An Infrastructure Like Linux
This is not just a standard system or program; think of it as a client similar to the Brave browser, but far more extreme. By integrating currency, trading, and communication into one open-source program, we allow community plugins to flourish—acting as an integrated infrastructure much like Linux. 

There are no dedicated maintainers; **every user is a volunteer, and everyone supports the bottom layer.**

* **Currency & Trust:** To bypass the friction of building a new trust system, we natively support the three mainstream Web3 currencies: BTC, ETH, and USDT.
* **The Free Market:** Beyond NFTs, the integrated market supports the trading of physical goods.
* **Bridging Web2:** Why abandon your Web2 legacy? Early stages will support syncing with platforms like Discord and GitHub. You can sync resources, local data, and communication lists directly into our network.

## 5. Governance & Moderation: The Decentralized Protocol
How do we handle NSFW content or bad actors without central administrators?

* **Protocol-Level Supervision:** We implement a mutual supervision protocol. Violations of the protocol do not require reporting to an admin (because there are none).
* **Slashing & Faucets:** Offenses are penalized by deducting crypto assets. These deducted funds are sent to a specific address controlled by Smart Contracts, which acts as a "Faucet" to reward new members joining our Web3 network.
* **Real-World Game Theory:** Authorities can connect their own nodes to the authoritative servers, turning governments into a decentralized part of the network itself, rather than external supervisors.

## 6. Our Vision
We do not seek to build a unified, giant server. We are building a **"Global LAN"**. 
In this network, everyone is a base station, everyone is a hard drive, and everyone is sovereign. A decentralized island amidst centralization.
